# Haptic Swarm Interaction
A haptic device is used to control a swarm of robots in Argos, a software useful for swarm robot simulations

The primary idea here is to provide haptic feedback when the haptic device exceeds the bounds on the swarm's interaction parameters. Thus, the movements in the x, y and z axis of the haptic device are used to control the heading, the speed and the Lennard-Jones potential of the swarm. 

This project was inspired from the following paper:
O. Linda and M. Manic, "Fuzzy Force-Feedback Augmentation for Manual Control of Multirobot System," in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 58, no. 8, pp. 3213-3220, Aug. 2011.
